# Git Practice Simulator

A beginner-friendly, hands-on project designed to help you **practice essential Git and GitHub commands** using the command line. This website serves as a safe and visual playground where you can simulate real-world workflows like pushing, pulling, branching, and merging — perfect for beginners who want to build confidence using Git.

## 📚 Why I Made This Project

I created this project to provide a safe, interactive space for beginners and developers to practice Git commands without the risk of breaking real repositories. Sometimes it’s scary to mess around with real projects, so I wanted to build a fun, low-pressure environment where you can try things out, make mistakes, and get more comfortable using Git. The goal is to help users build confidence and fluency with Git in a simple, simulated setup.

## 📚 Project Purpose

This project is created to:

* Practice creating GitHub repositories using the command line.
* Simulate real Git workflows like saving, pushing, pulling, and fetching changes.
* Safely explore Git commands without worrying about breaking anything.
* Visualize your progress by working on actual website files.

---

## 🚀 Git Commands to Practice

* `git init`
* `git clone`
* `git status`
* `git add`
* `git commit`
* `git push`

Here’s your improved **Layout Guidelines** with the addition of your custom `utilities.css` usage:

---

## 📐 Layout Guidelines

- 🔹 **Use Bootstrap for Structure**
    - Utilize Bootstrap for all layout and spacing tasks, including padding, margins, containers, rows, and columns.

- 🔹 **Use Custom CSS for Styling**
    - Manage typography, colors, font sizes, font families, font weights, text colors, and background colors using your own CSS files.

- 🔹 **Use `utilities.css` for Reusable Classes**
    - You can use the provided `utilities.css` for quick access to custom helper classes for fonts, text sizes, colors, spacing, and more. This file is your go-to for consistent styling outside of Bootstrap.

- 🔹 **Avoid Inline Styles**
    - Keep the codebase clean and maintainable by avoiding inline styles. Always use Bootstrap classes, your custom `utilities.css`, or the main stylesheet for all styling.

---

If you’d like, I can help you write a **sample structure** on how to organize when to use Bootstrap, `utilities.css`, and `main.css` for maximum consistency. Want that? 😊

<!-- ## 📐 Layout Guidelines

- 🔹 **Bootstrap** handles all structural layout (padding, margins, containers, rows, columns).
- 🔹 **Your CSS** handles typography and colors (font size, font family, font weight, text color, background color, etc.)
- 🔹 **Avoid** inline style.

## ✅ How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/git-practice-simulator.git
```

2. **Make Local Changes**
   Add, edit, or delete files to simulate project updates.

3. **Practice Git Commands**
   Try adding, committing, pushing, pulling, branching, and merging.

4. **Repeat**
   Create new branches and simulate pull requests to improve your skills.
