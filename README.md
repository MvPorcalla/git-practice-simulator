# Git Practice Simulator

A beginner-friendly, hands-on project designed to help you **practice essential Git and GitHub commands** using the command line. This website serves as a safe and visual playground where you can simulate real-world workflows like pushing, pulling, branching, and merging — perfect for beginners who want to build confidence using Git.

## 📚 Why I Made This Project

I created this project to provide a safe, interactive space for beginners and developers to practice Git commands without the risk of breaking real repositories. Sometimes it’s scary to mess around with real projects, so I wanted to build a fun, low-pressure environment where you can try things out, make mistakes, and get more comfortable using Git. The goal is to help users build confidence and fluency with Git in a simple, simulated setup.

## 📐 Layout Guidelines

- 🔹 **Bootstrap** handles all structural layout (padding, margins, containers, rows, columns).
- 🔹 **Your CSS** handles typography and colors (font size, font family, font weight, text color, background color, etc.)
- 🔹 **Avoid** inline style.

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/git-practice-simulator.git
```

2. **Make Local Changes**
   Add, edit, or delete files to simulate project updates.

3. **Practice Git Commands**
   Try adding, committing, pushing, pulling, branching, and merging.

4. **Repeat**
