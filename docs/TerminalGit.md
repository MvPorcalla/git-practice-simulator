# Git Playground - VS Code Replica Feature Documentation

## üìå Project Overview
The Git Playground will include a **VS Code-inspired UI replica** where users can:
- Create, rename, and delete files and folders using a sidebar.
- Simulate file management and project structuring.
- Use a connected terminal to run Git commands.
- Visualize Git status changes and push files to a simulated GitHub repository.

---

## üóÇÔ∏è VS Code Replica Feature Breakdown

### 1. Sidebar (File Explorer)
- Allows users to:
  - Create files and folders.
  - Rename files and folders.
  - Delete files and folders.
- Displays the **visual file tree structure**.
- Files have status indicators (Untracked, Staged, Committed).

---

### 2. File Tree Structure
- Simulate file system using a JavaScript object.
- Example:
```javascript
let fileSystem = {
    name: 'root',
    type: 'folder',
    children: [
        { name: 'index.html', type: 'file', status: 'untracked' },
        { 
            name: 'src', 
            type: 'folder', 
            children: [
                { name: 'app.js', type: 'file', status: 'untracked' }
            ]
        }
    ]
};
````

### 3. Git Status Indicators

* Each file will display its current Git status:

  * Untracked
  * Staged
  * Committed
* File icons or labels should visually indicate the status.

---

### 4. Terminal Integration

* Terminal will be connected to the VS Code replica:

  * Changes made in the sidebar will be reflected in the terminal (file availability).
  * Git commands typed in the terminal will update the file statuses in the sidebar.
* **Two-Way Sync:**

  * GUI actions affect terminal Git state.
  * Terminal commands update the GUI file statuses.

---

### 5. Visual Commit History (Optional)

* Display commit history similar to VS Code Git Graph.
* Show commit messages and branch history visually.
* Useful for simulating branching and merging in the future.

---

### 6. Dark/Light Mode

* Smooth toggle between dark and light mode.
* Theme changes will apply to:

  * Sidebar
  * Terminal
  * File Explorer
  * Background and text

---

## üéÆ User Flow

1. User creates files and folders in the sidebar.
2. User switches to the terminal to run Git commands.
3. Git command outputs are displayed in the terminal.
4. File statuses update visually based on Git commands.
5. User can push files to a simulated GitHub repository.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Suggested Build Order

1. Build Sidebar with file/folder creation, deletion, and renaming.
2. Build visual file tree and status indicators.
3. Connect terminal to sidebar (file system sync).
4. Implement basic Git command parsing.
5. Build dark/light mode toggle.
6. (Optional) Add visual Git history panel.

---

## ‚úÖ Core Features Checklist

* [ ] Sidebar for file/folder management.
* [ ] Terminal with Git command input.
* [ ] File status indicators (untracked, staged, committed).
* [ ] Simulated GitHub push.
* [ ] Dark/Light mode with animation.
* [ ] Two-way sync between terminal and sidebar.

---

## üöÄ Future Expansion

* Visual branch management.
* Real-time tutorials and challenges within the VS Code UI.
* Multiplayer Git practice (team simulation).

---

## üìö Summary

The **VS Code Replica** in the Git Playground provides a familiar UI that mimics modern development workflows. It enhances learning by offering a **visual and interactive Git experience** where file management and terminal commands work together seamlessly.

This feature is designed to make Git learning **beginner-friendly, immersive, and close to real-world environments.**
